22.06.
The kick-off meeting was for 30 mins. A couple of project topics were discussed, and the feasibility was discussed.
We agreed that I would survey the topics for a short while and get back within evening with a topic for dissertation. 
By evening I confirmed the dissertation topic to the professor. Other general advice regarding running the project was given out. 
The next meeting was agreed to be on next week where the task is to do background reading on the dissertation

The progress from the last week and the short summary of the survey was presented. Professor was happy with both. 
The plan for next week and the overall project plan was presented. Advice was given to focus on text defining the project scope. 
Guidelines on building the dataset was given. 
Advice to write the intro chapter of dissertation and design proposal was given. 
Task to look into variations in a chart. Start building the dataset. 
Getting hands dirty with development techniques. 
Think about the degree to which the software is to be automatic.

This was a group meeting lasting about 1.5 hrs. Valuable ideas were shared between group mates reagrding their projects. 
For my part, I explained the work done in the last week which includes survey of CNN classifiers, building the dataset, writing the 
introduction part of dissertation and the hand-on experience with the limitations of the opensource tool tesseract (python) for text extraction and opencv for object
detection. Due to the limitations and inaccuracy of opensource tools, advice was given to first focus on classification of chart images and to work
on data extraction if time permits. Advice to generate synthetic charts was given. Plan for this week is to work on:
- building the initial classifier 
- expanding the dataset to include more chart types
- work on introduction and background chapters of dissertation
- find possible classification techniques

13.07
This is was an individual meeting lasting 30 mins. Professor was happy with the progress made from last week. The configuration of baseline model was explained and intention to use transfer learning for image classification was proposed. Professor was happy for me to continue with transfer learning, while giving advice on using pre-trained model on synthetic images rather than imagenet. Advice was given to think about localization, chart image generation, synthetic documents with randomized chart images, worling with distorted chart images (comparing with human recognition) and predicting the parts of charts as many options to move ahead in the project. This week's task is to:
- Survey the above mentioned options to implement
- Start draft of background chapter
- Investigate and implement transfer learning approach for image classification
- Work on labelling the dataset (if necessary)

21.07
This was a group meeting lasting 1.5 hrs. I presented my progress from last week and explained the challenges I faced and how I overcame them. Advice was given to experiment on data augmentation and varying the learning rate & weights decay for transfer learning image classification. In terms of object detection, the professor agreed with my choice of labels to detect (title, axis label, legend). We were informed that we wont have a meeting next week. Therefore, the task for the next 2 weeks include:
- Finalize the dataset
- Labelling the images
- Experiment and fine tune transfer learning
- Perform object detection using detecto package
- Continue working on autoencoders
- Explore localization using mask rcnn
- Explore color space augmentation for images
