The kick-off meeting was for 30 mins. A couple of project topics were discussed, and the feasibility was discussed.
We agreed that I would survey the topics for a short while and get back within evening with a topic for dissertation. 
By evening I confirmed the dissertation topic to the professor. Other general advice regarding running the project was given out. 
The next meeting was agreed to be on next week where the task is to do background reading on the dissertation

This was a group meeting lasting about 1.5 hrs. Valuable ideas were shared between group mates reagrding their projects. 
For my part, I explained the work done in the last week which includes survey of CNN classifiers, building the dataset, writing the 
introduction part of dissertation and the hand-on experience with the limitations of the opensource tool tesseract (python) for text extraction and opencv for object
detection. Due to the limitations and inaccuracy of opensource tools, advice was given to first focus on classification of chart images and to work
on data extraction if time permits. Advice to generate synthetic charts was given. Plan for this week is to work on:
- building the initial classifier 
- expanding the dataset to include more chart types
- work on introduction and background chapters of dissertation
- find possible classification techniques
